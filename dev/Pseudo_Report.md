## Introduction

In the era of high-throughput genomics, understanding the genetic regulation of gene expression has become a central focus in biomedical research. Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) mapping serves as a pivotal approach to identify genetic variants, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), that influence gene expression levels. However, the high dimensionality of genomic data—characterized by a vast number of SNPs relative to the number of samples—poses significant challenges for traditional statistical methods, often leading to issues like multicollinearity and overfitting.

To address these challenges, dimension reduction techniques like Partial Least Squares (PLS) regression have been employed. PLS is adept at handling situations where predictors are highly collinear and outnumber observations by projecting the predictors into a lower-dimensional space that captures the maximum covariance with the response variables. Building upon this, Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLS) regression introduces sparsity into the model, enabling simultaneous variable selection and dimension reduction. This is particularly advantageous in genomic studies where identifying a subset of relevant SNPs is crucial for interpretability and downstream biological validation.

In this project, we developed **GeneSPLS**, an R package designed to implement SPLS regression for eQTL analysis. The package leverages efficient C++ backends via Rcpp to enhance computational performance based on a publicaly available R package **spls**, making it suitable for large-scale genomic datasets. We applied GeneSPLS to simulated data along with a real data from the Geuvadis consortium, focusing on the AKT3 gene, which plays a significant role in cell proliferation and survival pathways. Our analysis aimed to uncover SNPs associated with AKT3 expression levels, providing insights into the gene's regulatory mechanisms.

By integrating advanced statistical modeling with high-performance computing, GeneSPLS offers a robust tool for researchers conducting eQTL analyses. The package not only facilitates the identification of key genetic variants influencing gene expression but also enhances the interpretability of complex genomic data, thereby contributing to our understanding of gene regulation and its implications in health and disease.
